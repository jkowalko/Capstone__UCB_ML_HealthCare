### Project Title
Capstone Project: HealthCare Billing Amount Prediction 
**Author**
John Kowalkowski , MBA 

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

This project will predict the hospital billing using patient and admission data from the "HealthCare_Dataset.csv" found on Kaggle.com. The output will achieve accurate cost forecasts to in an effort to optimze hospital resource planning and insurance negetiations. These forecasts could potentially reduce financial overhead by 15-20% based on industry benchmarks today.

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

Research Question: How can patient profiles and admission details be used to accurately predict hospital billing amounts to optimize resource allocation and insurance negotiations?

This project will focus on predicting the hospital billing by using patient and admission data from the "HealthCare_Dataset.csv" found on Kaggle.com. The output will achieve accurate cost forecasts in an effort to optimze hospital resource planning and insurance negetiations. These forecasts could potentially reduce financial overhead by 15-20% based on industry benchmarks today.

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?
[HealthCare Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset) provided by Kaggle. 

About Dataset
Context:
This synthetic healthcare dataset has been created to serve as a valuable resource for data science, machine learning, and data analysis enthusiasts. It is designed to mimic real-world healthcare data, enabling users to practice, develop, and showcase their data manipulation and analysis skills in the context of the healthcare industry.

Inspiration:
The inspiration behind this dataset is rooted in the need for practical and diverse healthcare data for educational and research purposes. Healthcare data is often sensitive and subject to privacy regulations, making it challenging to access for learning and experimentation. To address this gap, I have leveraged Python's Faker library to generate a dataset that mirrors the structure and attributes commonly found in healthcare records. By providing this synthetic data, I hope to foster innovation, learning, and knowledge sharing in the healthcare analytics domain.

Dataset Information:
Each column provides specific information about the patient, their admission, and the healthcare services provided, making this dataset suitable for various data analysis and modeling tasks in the healthcare domain. Here's a brief explanation of each column in the dataset -

Name: This column represents the name of the patient associated with the healthcare record.
Age: The age of the patient at the time of admission, expressed in years.
Gender: Indicates the gender of the patient, either "Male" or "Female."
Blood Type: The patient's blood type, which can be one of the common blood types (e.g., "A+", "O-", etc.).
Medical Condition: This column specifies the primary medical condition or diagnosis associated with the patient, such as "Diabetes," "Hypertension," "Asthma," and more.
Date of Admission: The date on which the patient was admitted to the healthcare facility.
Doctor: The name of the doctor responsible for the patient's care during their admission.
Hospital: Identifies the healthcare facility or hospital where the patient was admitted.
Insurance Provider: This column indicates the patient's insurance provider, which can be one of several options, including "Aetna," "Blue Cross," "Cigna," "UnitedHealthcare," and "Medicare."
Billing Amount: The amount of money billed for the patient's healthcare services during their admission. This is expressed as a floating-point number.
Room Number: The room number where the patient was accommodated during their admission.
Admission Type: Specifies the type of admission, which can be "Emergency," "Elective," or "Urgent," reflecting the circumstances of the admission.
Discharge Date: The date on which the patient was discharged from the healthcare facility, based on the admission date and a random number of days within a realistic range.
Medication: Identifies a medication prescribed or administered to the patient during their admission. Examples include "Aspirin," "Ibuprofen," "Penicillin," "Paracetamol," and "Lipitor."
Test Results: Describes the results of a medical test conducted during the patient's admission. Possible values include "Normal," "Abnormal," or "Inconclusive," indicating the outcome of the test.

#### Methodology
